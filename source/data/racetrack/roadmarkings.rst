Road markings
==============

You can find below all road markings and their dimension. The lane markings may be dashed or continuous 
and are ~2cm wide white line. The lane has a width of ~35 cm, measured from the inside of the respective 
markings. In the case of dashed markings, the line has a length 4.5 cm and the distance between two marks 
is similarly 4.5 cm.

As for the highway, the width of the lane is approximately 37 cm, where the lines are 4 cm in width
and the dotted line is of 9x9 cm (full and empty color).

The following image shows the tightest curve, which is the most common curve on the track.

**Starting point**
The starting point is made out of an incomplete rectangle, which is exactly the width of the vehicle (20cm)
and ends 56 cm from the chessboard print. 

The chessboard print is made out of a 7x6 squares matrix, occupying the entire width of the lane (5cm square).

The chessboard can be used for the automatic calibration of the camera.
