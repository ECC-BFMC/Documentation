Traffic signs
=============

Signs
'''''''''''''

On the track can appear four types of traffic sign:
 - Stop sign
 - Parking sign
 - Priority sign
 - Crosswalk sign
 - Highway entrance sign
 - Highway exit sign
 - Round-about sign
 - One way road sign
 - No-entry road sign
 
You can find the traffic signs in pdf format at the following link:

    - `traffic signs`_ 

.. _`traffic signs`: https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/templates/TrafficSign.pdf

Each sign is encapsulate in a 6x6 cm square (scaled accordingly. You can see two examples in the picture below:

   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

The pillars of the traffic sign are ~18.5 cm and the sign is placed at in the middle of the pole positioning surface.
The complete heigh of the traffic sign is ~20cm. You can see an example below. A sample in STL format is given in the '3D printed components' section.

   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

In the reality they look like on the pictures below:

   :align: center
   :scale: 10%

-----------------------
On the race track we place elements that are printed or built. The model for these posts you can download from following links:
    - `Traffic sign base`_
    - `Traffic sign pole`_
