Positioning on track
====================

The locations of traffic sign and light are similar and are calculated with respect to the object center. Each object is located 10 cm before 
(or after, in depending on the case of the parking spot) the road signalization and 5 cm outside the road limits.

Exceptions to this rule are the highway traffic signs and:
    - Highway entry. There's a sign right at the intersection of the highway entrance
    - Highway exit. There's a sign before the dotted lane starts
