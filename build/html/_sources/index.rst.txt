Welcome to BFMC's documentation!
================================

Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) is an international student technical competition of Bosch Engineering Center Cluj since 2017. Our partner 
is IEEE-ITSS. In this competition the participants have to to implement autonomous driving alghoritms on a vehicle at 1/10 scale, provided by Robert 
Bosch.

This is the official documentation of the competition and it includes the descriptions of the given code, the race-track and it's elements, V2X 
systems, diagrams, hardware, as well as a starting point and directions of the knowledge required for the best experience.

The Brain project is already installed on the provided Raspberry Pi, while the embedded project is already implemented on the Nucleo board, while 
the computer project needs to be installed on a PC.
